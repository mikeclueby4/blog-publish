**Privileged Contexts** is a personal technical blog focused on security, detection & response, and the secure use of AI/agentic tooling.

The name is a play on words — in security, a "privileged context" is an execution environment with elevated access. LLMs use context windows. In writing, it's the author's vantage point. This blog sits at the intersection.

## What you'll find here

- Security engineering and architecture
- Detection & response patterns
- AI/LLM security and agentic tooling
- Practical approaches to real-world problems

## About the site

This site is statically generated with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and deployed to Cloudflare Pages. It's designed to be fast, accessible, and agent-friendly — every post is available as both HTML and raw Markdown for LLM ingestion.
